## Q1
Write python code to read a file as specified in command line, parse the file
such as the attached json file, remove duplicated entries in "items" array and
ignore the difference in fields "lastUsedDate", "revisionDate", "creationDate",
"deletedDate", "folderId", "collectionIds" and "id". Output of elements in
"items" should be sorted first by "name" field, then by "id" field.

Gemini doesn't allow uploading of JSON file in the free version.
