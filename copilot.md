## Q1
Write python code to read a file as specified in command line, parse the file
such as the attached json file, remove duplicated entries in "items" array and
ignore the difference in fields "lastUsedDate", "revisionDate", "creationDate",
"deletedDate", "folderId", "collectionIds" and "id". Output of elements in
"items" should be sorted first by "name" field, then by "id" field.

Microsoft Copilot (Think Deeper off):

Certainly! Here's a Python script that fulfills your request:

```python
import json
import sys

def normalize_item(item):
    # Remove fields that should not be considered for duplication
    keys_to_remove = ["lastUsedDate", "revisionDate", "creationDate", "deletedDate", "folderId", "collectionIds", "id"]
    return {key: value for key, value in item.items() if key not in keys_to_remove}

def read_and_process_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    if "items" not in data:
        print("No 'items' array found in the file.")
        return

    items = data["items"]

    # Remove duplicates based on normalized items
    seen = set()
    unique_items = []
    for item in items:
        normalized = json.dumps(normalize_item(item), sort_keys=True)
        if normalized not in seen:
            seen.add(normalized)
            unique_items.append(item)

    # Sort by 'name' field, then by 'id' field
    unique_items.sort(key=lambda x: (x.get("name", ""), x.get("id", "")))

    # Replace original items with unique sorted ones
    data["items"] = unique_items

    # Output the result
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python script.py <file_path>")
    else:
        file_path = sys.argv[1]
        read_and_process_file(file_path)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Normalization**: A helper function `normalize_item` removes the specified fields when comparing items for duplication.
2. **Deduplication**: A `set` is used to track unique normalized items.
3. **Sorting**: The items are sorted first by the `name` field, then by the `id` field.
4. **File Handling**: The script reads the JSON file specified in the command line and outputs the processed content.

You can save this script as `script.py`, and then run it with a command like:
```
python script.py bitwarden-sample.json
```
